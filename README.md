### USAGE

```cpp
#include "Box2D.hpp" // changed Box2D.h -> Box2D.hpp
int main()
{
	b2WorldImpl world; // changed (b2World -> b2WorldImpl)
    // ...
	// same api
    // ...
}
```

It is not very meaningful, but it was made just to spend a boring weekend. I tested it on MacOS only. It will probably run on Windows, but I plan to test it soon.
